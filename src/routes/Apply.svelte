		Stay tuned for applications! We need to meet our fundraising goal first. In the meantime, we
		encourage potential applicants to identify what type of growing space they are looking for and
		search for potential spaces. The intention of this fund is to support/subsidize land ownership
		for farmers of color. Please share on social media or check out our calls to action here
