	The land fund was envisioned by community members including aspiring and current farmers of color
	in the Grand Rapids area. The members below have enacted this vision and done the administrative
	work to make it happen so far. As we continue to grow, more community members are becoming
	involved in supporting this work! Please fill out our <a href="/Contact-Us">contact form</a> if you'd

		My name is Elizabeth, though I go by Liz. I am not the first person in my family to farm, though
		I am the only person in my family who is farming as a profession currently. I manage the
		Blandford Nature Center Farm in Grand Rapids, and have been working there since 2016.
	</p>
	<p>
		I received a B.A. from Grand Valley State University with an emphasis in Illustration. The more
		I learn, whether it’s about soil management, a new knitting technique, or making connections in
		the community, the more I see how everything is interconnected. I believe in reciprocity, and
		that the creation of an equitable food system benefits everyone.

		programming and community garden projects.

		In her free time you can find Alita with her partner, Sergio, and their two daughters, Willow

	<p>
		My name is Angela. I received a B.A. from Grand Valley State University in Environmental &
		Sustainability Studies and Anthropology. I love working with communities to build equitable and
		sustainable food systems. I want to offer access to food that celebrates the culture of that
		community.
	</p>
	<p>
		My passion led me to work at the South East Market in its early stage, become the manager and
		contribute to its growth. I am now working at Blandford Nature Center Farm, which is teaching me
		the skills and knowledge to more intentionally aid the growth of a resilient food system here in
		West Michigan.
	</p>
	<p>
		Change has to happen on the ground, with reciprocity and care at its center. I believe that
		sharing knowledge and offering opportunities for the communities facing systemic barriers can
		lead to a more equitable and resilient food system. I am motivated by the curiosity of children
		and the drive community members have to build their relationship with the land. We have lots of
		work to do together, but there is so much beauty on the other side.

		My name is Mik (she/they). I am a first generation, queer, young farmer in the West Michigan
		area. Two seasons ago I started a small farm called <a href="https://www.stillwindfarmllc.com/"
			>Stillwind</a
		>, which is now a 1/2 acre, low till, Certified Naturally Grown operation. I also work full time
		at Full Hollow Farm & volunteer on both the West MI Young Farmers Chapter &
		<a href="https://www.wmgrowersgroup.org/">West MI Growers Group</a> boards. I find joy & rest while
		enjoying meals with others, reading, & spending time outside!
	</p>
	<p>
		With plentiful barriers to entry & systematic issues, I find it is inspiring to work alongside
		local farmers, community members, & leaders to hopefully cultivate a more equitable food system
		& industry for young, BIPOC, queer, aspiring growers.
