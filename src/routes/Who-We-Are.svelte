<p>
	The land fund was envisioned by community members including aspiring and current farmers of color
	in the Grand Rapids area. The members below have enacted this vision and done the administrative
	work to make it happen so far. As we continue to grow, more community members are becoming
	involved in supporting this work!

	<h1>Mikayla Rowden</h1>
	<Divide />
	<p>
		My name is Mik (she/they). I am a first generation, queer, young farmer in the West Michigan
		area. Two seasons ago I started a small farm called Stillwind, which is now a 1/2 acre, low
		till, Certified Naturally Grown operation. I also work full time at Full Hollow Farm & volunteer
		on both the West MI Young Farmers Chapter & West MI Growers Group boards. I find joy & rest
		while enjoying meals with others, reading, & spending time outside!
	</p>
	<p>
		With plentiful barriers to entry & systematic issues, I find it is inspiring to work alongside
		local farmers, community members, & leaders to hopefully cultivate a more equitable food system
		& industry for young, BIPOC, queer, aspiring growers.
