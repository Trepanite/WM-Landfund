	<h1>How it Started</h1>
	<Divide />
	<p>
		We were inspired to start organizing by the farmer-chapter model created by the <a
			href="http://youngfarmers.org"
			title="youngfarmers.org">National Young Farmers Coalition</a
		>, a policy-advocacy organization that supports the gathering and advocacy work of 51 localized
		farmer-chapters across the country. We came to this work hoping to create systemic change in
		West Michigan, and as we saw the values of land skyrocketing in Grand Rapids, we decided to
		focus on land access. Inspired by the foundational work of the Detroit Black Farmer Land Fund
		and Washtenaw County Black Farmer Fund, we knew something like this could happen in West
		Michigan too. So we began hosting informal listening and visioning sessions with current and
		aspiring farmers of color in the Grand Rapids area. These conversations collectively visioned
		our current effort, the

	<h1>The West Michigan Farmers of Color Land Fund</h1>
	<Divide />
	<p>
		We want to bring farmers, farmhands, and aspiring farmers into an organizing effort that uplifts
		farmers of color, therefore empowering the whole farming community. Our work aims to support
		Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color (BIPOC) in reclaiming agricultural practices,
		which can rebuild a connection to land, community, and healthy foods. We know that having access
		to land empowers communities to be self-sufficient, food secure and resilient in the face of
		climate chaos and unstable global food systems. Our goal is to address past generational
		injustices and create pockets of BIPOC-owned green growing space in urban settings of West
		Michigan to increase food security and community resiliency. While 40% of farmland in the
		country is leased, we know this leads to unsustainable operations, lacking the ability to
		securly invest in your farm. Land ownership is the only pathway towards a just, equitable and
		sustainable future for farmers.

	<h1>Why farmers of color?</h1>
	<Divide />
	<p>
		People of color are drastically underrepresented in farming nationally, especially Black
		farmers, who make up less than 2% of farmers in the US, and only 0.4% in Michigan. In West MI,
		there are only about 10 farmers of color that we know of and many more aspiring growers and
		farmworkers. However, there are limited safe and appropriate opportunities for BIPOC aspiring
		farmers to thrive. Most rural land is in isolating environments and too far from the communities
		that many of these folks live in and want to serve. Options for urban farming are limited too;
		there are only 60 vacant lots in the city of Grand Rapids, the largest city in West Michigan.
		Most of these lots are too small for an operation to be able to scale, while most other green
		space is owned by collaborative churches or developers. We investigated all the vacant lots of
		Grand Rapids and have identified a few that could be viable for urban agriculture. We are
		drafting a proposal for the planning committee of Grand Rapids with the hopes that they will
		give land to farmers of color before it is taken by gentrifying developers like companies owned
		by the DeVos family.
	</p>

	<p>
		We fully support efforts that focus on Black farmers, like the Detroit and Washtenaw Black
		Farmer Land Funds. We decided to open our movement up to all farmers of color, because of the
		population dynamics and demographics in our region. While supporting as many farmers of color as
		possible, we still aim to center Black aspiring farmers in this work. You can read more about
